A site where people can put items up for sales and bid on them!

After creating your account, you can check all the available items to bid and add the ones you're interested in to your watchlist.
Every item's current bid, comments, user, category and image of it is shows. 
Creating a post is simple and easy. When creating it you upload pic, write a desc and choose category and the minimal bid.

Very useful like Ebay, Amazon etc.
